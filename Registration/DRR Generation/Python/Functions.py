    ChangeImageDirection(oldDirection,newDirection,DimensionOut)
        Changes the old Direction to a new direction (given the image dimension).
        Input Arguments: 
            oldDirection : The original direction of the image e.g. image.GetDirection() 
            newDirection : The direction that we like to set the image direction to. 
            DimensionOut : The dimension of the image that we like to output (2D or 3D)
