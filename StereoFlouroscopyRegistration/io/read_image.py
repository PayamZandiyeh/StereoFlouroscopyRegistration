def get_itk_homogeneous_coordinate_matrix(file_name):
    '''Read the homogeneous coordinates matrix in ITK.

    The coordinates are in the ITK frame of reference. In general, the
    ITK coordinate system indexes at point (P) from the image index (I)
    using an origin (O), an orthonormal direction cosine matrix (D), and
    diagnoal spacing matrix (S).
        P = O + D * diag(S) * I
    We keep the homogeneous coordinates as such:
        T = [ D | O ]
    We assume that VTK will take care of the image spacing for us, which
    is a reasonable assumption.

    None is returned if no itkImageIO is found. It is possible that
    an image is readable by VTK but no orientation can be found by
    ITK. It is also possible that an image is reordered when read by
    VTK causing the image to have a different orientation than ITK would
    expect.

    Args:
        file_name (string):     Image dimensions
